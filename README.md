# biogas-plant-mixed-integer-linear-program
Operation research to find the perfect location of biogas plants in order to maximize the incomes generated by those plants. I'm using the python mip library in order to solve this problem. Use Jupyter notebook. 

# Biogas Location Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and optimize the location of biogas production facilities using data-driven insights. The provided Jupyter Notebook contains data processing, visualization, and analytical models to determine optimal locations for biogas plants based on various parameters.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Geospatial analysis for location optimization
- Visualization of potential biogas locations
- Statistical insights and decision-making support

## Usage
1. Open the `biogas_location_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the notebook cells to load and process the data.
3. Execute the visualization steps to explore insights.
4. Modify parameters as needed to refine location analysis.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- geopandas (for geospatial analysis)
- folium (for interactive maps)

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains location-based information relevant to biogas plant placement. The data is preprocessed and analyzed within the Jupyter Notebook.
